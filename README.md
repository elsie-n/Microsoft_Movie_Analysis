# Microsoft Movies Analysis
This an analysis project that aims at analyzing and deriving findings that will give helpful insights to Microsoft company looking at starting a movie studio.

Settled on using three datasets namely:
- imdb.title.basics
- imdb.title.ratings
- bom.movie_gross

The three dataframes were combined to come up with one (Combined_df) for easy manipulation and finding insights relatable to the all availablle data.

From this findings and insights should be retrived to recomend Microsoft company about their new adventure on starting  a movie studio.

## Lead Questions include:
- What are some of the most common studios (Competitors) to narrow down what there advantage over others are ?

- What are the top popular genres ?

- Does the number of votes and ratings correlate ?

- Does the domestic gross(budget) affect the ratings ?

- What are the correlations of diffrent genres and other attributes ?

## Conclusions

We have drawn many interesting inferences from the dataset Netflix titles; here's a summary of the few of them:

The most genre type is drama with the least as news,

The most popular studio is Uni followed closely with IFC,

The amount of Domestic Gross does affect the rating of the movie,

Some Genre Combinations are more relatable to each other unlike others,

The number of votes does affect the rating of a movie.

## Recommendations

The studios that should be invested in should be either Fox, Uni, WB or IFC

The company should consider starting with the production of drama genre movies.

A team to engage with the viewers should be put in oder to engage with them by creating polls to get their views and understand their target audience well enough.
